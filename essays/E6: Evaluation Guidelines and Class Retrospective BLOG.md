Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My system is a store that specializes in shoes but also has various apparel and accessories. I modeled mine after the vans store because I love vans and this would be my take on a shoe store. 

Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

A notable shortcoming is that my email does not work. I did a lot of research and added sufficient code but was not able to get it to work.

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

What I am most proud of with my application is how it looks and the feature of rating a product is pretty cool to me especially since i love reading reviews and like rating products in real life. I like that the nav bar adjusts even when there is a lot of text up there which is what I struggled with for a while, and I think that everything looks clean and simple. 

Describe what you are least happy with your system:

What I am least happy with is that I was not able to get the email to work as intended. 

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

Developing this assignment was different from assignment 2 because it was a lot of defining and finding where I stored my data to retrieve it. I took a lot more in-depth research than assignment 2 where I could pick out the bolded words in what I was reading. 

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

When I ran into a problem I would address the line that would give me an error then read the souraning lines before and after. I would also put bursts of code into chat gpt to find syntax errors. I also would ask for help from the professor when I was struggling. 

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment.

What worked well in this assignment was logging in and out of the user data. I found that implementing the login and log-out with cookies was very understandable. I also think that the CSS over time was better managed. 

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment.

What did not work well in this assignment was the nodemailer. I examined the example code looked the internet, YouTube, and TikTok and was not able to figure out how to get it to email me the invoice. 

What did you learn from doing this assignment?

What I learned from doing this assignment was cookies and sessions. How important they are in everyday applications. I also learned that to do something well the first step is to truly understand the concept before just throwing stuff in my code. 

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

If I could go back what I would do differently is working in a group. I think that working in a group and being able to deeply focus on a certain topic would have come in handy. 

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging. 

30% thinking, 20% writing, 50% testing and debugging

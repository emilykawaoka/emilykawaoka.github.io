  <p>1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Assignment was learning about logging user data to have security and personalizations on the ecomerce website. The requirments were to either log in or register then to get to the invoice. But making it secure so you cant access the invoice unless you either created an account or logged into an existing account. When creating an account a password needed to meet specific requriments or the user needed to choose a differet password. More details on assignment 2 [here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/) 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>2. What did you learn from this assignment?</p>
<p> What I learned from this assignment was defenitly a better grasp on if statments. I really feel like I can say it out loud then get a good if statment to work.I also learned about saving new data with fs.writeFileSync. And that leads to learning how to retreive the data which I did through a query string. And learned how to personalize the display from data in the qurey string. </p>
<p>3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</p>
<p> I did not work with a partner. And I think time managment and started early and asking for help early really helped me finish the assignmetn on time. </p>
<p>4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</p>
<p> I got help when needed by going to the professor. I needed help with the quury string in getting the data from the purchase through the log in or registration to the invoice. I also found going back to the labs really helped. </p>
<p>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</p>
<p> Developing this  assignment was differnet than assignment 1 because it was more technical stuff than presentation. I required me to look up more things and to understand what I was reading and if I was copying what I was copying so that I could adapt it to my code. Knowing which parts are needed of somthing that I looked up was definitely through tiral and error on what was needed and not needed. </p>
<p>6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</p>
<p> Thinking about how to do somthing was maybe 30% of the time, becuase that was also me googling to understand the concept too. 20% writing the code. 50% testing and debugging. I was writing too much before testing so I  had to spend a good amount of time debbugging my work. And my debugger was not working that well so I resorted to the console. And reading the error messeges when I would refresh the page.  </p>
<p>7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</p>
<p> What worked well with this project was the validations becuase I found that fun. What did not work well was the query stings and the personalization. Building off of what we had done in class was supper helpful too. </p>
<p>8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</p>
<p> If I could go back in time and do things differently would be to do more research and understand the concepts a lot more before I started writitng things so that I wouldnt have to back track so much. </p>

  <p>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</p>
<p>My programming skills have improved in understanding the basics of code as a whole, and building code as if I were to build a sentence. As I learned the individual parts I began to see how components worked to create a full working “sentence”. I have also learned how and where to put js, html, css, json, and how to intertwine them all to create a cohesive program. Also learning how to read the inspector in the browser really helped me pinpoint the errors in my code. </p>
<p> I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</p>
<p>I need to work on the original and build my code. I say that I need to work on this because yes I understand the basics now but knowing when and how to use functions and things I still find quite challenging. There are many ways to create the same function and I think I need to work on thinking simpler to not over complicate what I write so it's easier for me and the computer to understand what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</p>
<p>After I would watch the screencasts and read a bit on my own and after many times I think I would definitely get the hang of the workings of the wod. I find that getting under the time really makes me repeat and helps me learn why I'm doing something and how it affects the website.</p>
<p>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</p>
<p>The labs definitely help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence because we are able to do it as a class and it really relates to the wod or the assignment. When following along and the progress of each part of the lab really helps me see the effect of each aspect of code. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</p>
<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing assignment 1 and feel I am ready to work on assignment 2 because I know how to allocate my time with how much work these assignments take. And I think that when doing the labs it really helps with the assignments.</p>
<p>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</p>
<p>I think this class can be improved to help my learning by just providing more resources or where to look, to understand the material. Like more youtube videos or good websites to use. Personally I don't really like w3 schools and find it a little difficult to get around that website.</p>
<p>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</p>
<p>What helped me the most in class were the screencasts and one one help. I think that the screen casts help me because I am able to learn at my own pace. I can pause and play the video and give myself as much time as I need to digest the information. And I think that the one on one help really helps me because I am able to learn at the pace I need to go at and can really zone in on the areas that I don't understand.</p>

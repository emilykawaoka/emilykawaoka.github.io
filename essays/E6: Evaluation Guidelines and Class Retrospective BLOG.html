  <p>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</p>

<p>My system is a store that specializes in shoes but also has various apparel and accessories. I modeled mine after the vans store because I love vans and this would be my take on a shoe store.</p>

<p>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</p>

<p>A notable shortcoming is that my email does not work. I did a lot of research and added sufficient code but was not able to get it to work. I tried different hosts to test it but was unable to get it working on the uh server. although at one point I was able to get an email but it went to spam and did not notice it till I had changed my code already.</p>

<p>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</p>

<p>What I am most proud of with my application is how it looks and the feature of rating a product is pretty cool to me especially since I love reading reviews and like rating products in real life. I like that the nav bar adjusts even when there is a lot of text up there which is what I struggled with for a while, and I think that everything looks clean and simple.</p>

<p>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</p>

<p>What I am least happy with is that I was not able to get the email to work as intended.</p>

<p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</p>

<p>Developing this assignment was different from assignment 2 because it was a lot of defining and finding where I stored my data to retrieve it. I took a lot more in-depth research than assignment 2 where I could pick out the bolded words in what I was reading.</p>

<p>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</p>

<p>When I ran into a problem I would address the line that would give me an error then read the souraning lines before and after. I would also put bursts of code into chat gpt to find syntax errors. I also would ask for help from the professor when I was struggling.</p>

<p>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment.</p>

<p>What worked well in this assignment was logging in and out of the user data. I found that implementing the login and log-out with cookies was very understandable. I also think that the CSS over time was better managed.</p>

<p>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment.</p>

<p>What did not work well in this assignment was the nodemailer. I examined the example code on the internet, YouTube, and TikTok, and was not able to figure out how to get it to email me the invoice.</p>

<p>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</p>

<p>What I learned from doing this assignment was understanding the concept of something is very crucial before copying and pasting. And this applies to all classes where I need to learn the material and then try to apply my understanding. If I do it the other way then I just get more and more confused and would need to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</p>

<p>If I could go back what I would do differently is working in a group. I think that working in a group and being able to deeply focus on a certain topic would have come in handy.</p>

<p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging.</p>

<p>30% thinking, 20% writing, 50% testing and debugging</p>
